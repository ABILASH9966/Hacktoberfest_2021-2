## Problem statement:

### - Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

### - When a number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number, it should print 'Fizz'.

### - When a number is divisible by 5 then instead of printing the number, it should print 'Buzz'.

### - And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g 15 then instead of printing the number, it should print 'FizzBuzz'.

### - Feel free to add any other solutions to the FizzBuzz challenge!
