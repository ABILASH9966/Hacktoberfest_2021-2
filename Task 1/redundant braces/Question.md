##Problem
A string of characters is given as input and it is checked if it has redundant braces or not. 
This can be done using stacks as it is one of the important applications of stack data structure. 
If the expression or sub-expression is surrounded by extra or unnecessary braces, then the expression
is said to have redundant brackets.
