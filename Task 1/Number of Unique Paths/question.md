Given a A X B matrix with your initial position at the top-left cell, find the number of possible unique paths to reach the bottom-right cell of the matrix from the initial position.

Note: Possible moves can be either down or right at any point in time, i.e., we can move to matrix[i+1][j] or matrix[i][j+1] from matrix[i][j].
