## __Unique Rectangle Problem__
___

You are given N unit squares (squares with side length 1 unit), and you are asked to make rectangles using these squares.

You have to count the number of rotationally unique rectangles than you can make.

What does rotationally unique mean? Well, two rectangles are rotationally unique if one can’t be rotated to become equivalent to the other one.

### __Example__
___
The 4×2 rectangle can be rotated 90 degrees clockwise to make it the exact same as the 2×4 rectangle and so these are not rotationally unique.
