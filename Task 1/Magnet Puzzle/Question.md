We are given set of bipolar magnets each domino-shaped. The objective is to place magnets on a M X N board
which should meet a set of conditions where both N and M are not odd.

For instance, attached problem in (png format) has solution on its right.
Each 2 x 1 or 1 x 2 grid in the board can contain a magnet or can be empty.
The blank entry will be indicated by X’s and the magnet will be represented by + and – (For positive and negative end respectively).
The digits along the left and top sides of the board represent the count of + squares in corresponding rows or columns.
Similarly, those along the right and bottom show the number of – signs in particular rows or columns.
Rows and columns for which no number is mentioned can have any number of + or – signs.
The puzzle solution must also satisfy the constraint that no two adjacent squares can have the same sign. But diagonally joined squares can have same sign.
